We are all profesional software developers, we love to code so here we are :)

We come from developing countries (well at least two of us :P) and we work very 
hard to be at the level of developers from more developed countries, but the 
beauty of this career path is we all have the Internet, so its on us to sharp 
our skills and excel, that is what we are here to do!


About our skills and what you are going to do?
=======
We all have plenty of experience on web development, Andrei has a lot on game 
dev so we might be going that way with some cool HTML5 based game.
