About my team
===========================
I am a Web Engineer with experience working with LAMP and MEAN stacks, specialized in front-end web development and web application performance. I am a U.S. citizen living in Venezuela by the moment.

With the time, I have gotten senior knowledge in different technologies and functional areas of web development.
✔ Front-End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery and AngularJS.
✔ Back-End: PHP, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Node.js and Express.js.
✔ Database development: MySQL and MongoDB.
✔ Responsive Web Design.

I think this hackathon brings me a great opportunity to demonstrate my skills as Web Engineer, to meet new developers around the globe, besides to push me to create a product in just 48 hours.

About my skills and what I am going to do?
=======
I am deciding to work the theme #1 or #3, using the MEAN stack and d3.js for interactive data visualization. I hope to have time to use Foundation in order to make a beautiful webapp with responsive design.
