# A&A Team

We are Alton and Adrienne (A&A) and we are excited for our first hackaton experience! 


## About Us 

- Alton: I'm Alton and ummmm... I'm awesome?  
What's brown and sticky? Hint: It's not what you're thinking it is. 
Oh, by the way, life is like a mushroom. 


-Adrienne: Hi, I'm Adrienne! I am relatively new to programming and looking forward to an awesome learning experience through the global hackaton, with the help of my team leader and super awesome coder, Alton! Besides programming, I LOVE TO DANCE! If you don't see me studying or coding, then I'm in the studio dancing! 



## Languages We Love 

- EVERYTHING! :)
