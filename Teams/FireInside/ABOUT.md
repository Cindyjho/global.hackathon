I began doing freelance web development in high school, and had become disenchanted with it by the time I reached
University.  However, after working some co-op positions with some passionate web developers, I gained a appreciation
and insight for what the web is capable of.

Now, I'm all about pushing the limits of what the web can do.  I like to think I have some creative and innovative
ideas to bring to the table, and I'm excited to be taking part in the first ever Global Hackathon.  One day, when events
like this are commonplace, I'll be able to look back and say that I was there for the beginning!


Skills and Direction
=======

My passion has always been in interactive media, anything that takes entertainment beyond something to be simply
consumed, allowing people to influence and engage with it.  I love experimenting with new web technologies to
break expectations regarding the limitations of the web.  My hope is to combine my passion with these
technologies in a result that is both practical and delightful for users.
