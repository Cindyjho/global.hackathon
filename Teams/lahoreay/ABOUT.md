LAHOREAY
================
Lahoreay is a team of developers and a designer based in Lahore, Pakistan working in a same company. We have been brain storming on many ideas together, though never got a chance to materialize these ideas in to products. But now we believe Koding hackathon has given us a chance to actually conceive an idea and develop it into a working product.
