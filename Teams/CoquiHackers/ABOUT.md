# Coqui Hackers

We are students at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagu√ºez. We are currently doing a bachelor degree in Computer Engineering.
We are here to challenge ourselves.

## About Us

- Jesiniel: My name is Jesiniel. I live in Puerto Rico. I am currently a student at UPRM where I study Computer Engineering. I have worked with C and Java languages during my current studies. I have little knowledge in HTML and CSS, hoping this gets me somewhere in this hackathon. I am looking forward in learning other languages. I have interest in Javascript, Python and PHP.
