About our team

===========================
We are a group of programming enthusiasts very motivated to solve real world problems. All of us 
are students enrolled in colleges in the United States. We decided to join this competition 
because of our passion for programming and finding solutions for complex problems. We have prior
experience with developing applications making use of real time data to solve everyday problems.
Our biggest motivation behind us taking part in this competition is to get a really good 
feel of some of the API's mentioned in the document. We do not have much experience working with
these API's and would relish the opportunity to build something cool by utilizing them
