About my team (well, me really)
===========================
Team member: Naglaa Eid (aka nagheid or nag for short ;) )

I am a final year Software Engineering undergraduate student at the University of Ottawa in Ottawa, ON, Canada.

If I am not coding, I am either climbing walls or trying to get discovered by a bear in a forest. Or finding a roof in town that is cool enough to hang out on.

Why I decided to join?
=======
As a busy student with finals this week, I decided to join a hackathon for the fun of it. And trust me, they are super fun. Ah, I feel the adrenaline already!!

Between CO-OPs and part-time jobs, I have around 2.5 years of software experience. With an engineering degree, you'd think  when do I have time? And I don't. That's why I am joining this hackathon. After 5 years of studying engineering and filling my resume with high-tech jobs. I seek more "hackathony" experience to create the things *I* want ... I joined a hackathon by Facebook and it was the BEST thing ever. After that, I started treating all my assignments as hackathons. Pfff of course I don't leave them till the last minute just so I am  can pull an all-nighter and get it all working from scratch fully functional with extra features just for fun. No! ... Yes, yes I do. It feels so AWESOME to create something spectacular in a heck of a sleepless night.

About my skills
=======
I worked on back-end, front-end and everything in between. So far, I worked on 6 different projects and each used different technologies and were in varying fields (networking, cloud/OpenStack, vision processing, web development (check out OrbitHub.com), medical applications, ...)

Some of the languages I know: C, C++, HTML, CSS, Python, PHP, Perl, Java and others

What I are going to do?
=======
The project will be related to a distributed systems algorithm and will target themes 1, 2 and 4. 

If I say anything more, I will have to find you and kill you.

But it will be something awesome!
