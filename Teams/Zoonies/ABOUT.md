About the Team
===========================

We are the Zoonies! We're a group of burners & technology lovers from San Francisco and Utah!

TL;DR: Thomas, Patrick, and Ray (maybe?) work in some sort of job where they have stand-up meetings on a daily basis.  Pam is spending some time with electric cars and Breanna, source of light and joy, is our resident aesthician and wordsmith.

1. Pam is a long time technical consultant & Microsoft stack application developer turned lover of all things open source and currently getting her hands dirty slinging Ruby on Rails for fun. She is a generalist and can lay down a mean database schema at just the faintest whisper of a requirement with one hand while the other sketches out low-fi prototypes and workflows on any available surface.
2. Thomas comes to us with the energy only available to one borne of the stars.  I'm not sure what the hell it is he does, but I know he does it better than you do.
3. More details to come!
 

Skills and Plans
=======
As a combined team, we use these languages on the daily:
- Javascript
- Java
- Ruby on Rails
- What else, guys?

APIs that we are like include but are not limited to:
- Twitter
- Google Predictions
- Google Geocoding
- Google Freebase

Leaning toward theme #1, we're tossing around ideas of integrating environment, suprise data types, and biometrics data over time.  Looking to generate a web-kit app that can pull in data from a backend service with configurable data-feeds, probably leveraging PhoneGap or Apache Cordova.
