I am a young developer who was inspired by a robotics team in his highschool to work in the software development field. So far, I've worked over 3 years in internships and 3 hackathons with success.

I want to win this competition because I want to prove to myself that all my hard work of learning programming and development has paid off and that I can compete on a professional level. This field is hard and demanding and even though I may not have had the most technologically enriching environment growing up, my gusto and ingenuity will be my keys to victory.

Plan
=======
I am not 100% sure what I want to do yet. I am still working on an idea but a couple of technologies that I have at my disposal include but are not limited to:

* Android Development (Phone, tablet, and Glass)
* Web Technologies (Php, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript/JQuery)
* Face ++ (Facial Recognition API)
* Facebook API
* Arduino Development
