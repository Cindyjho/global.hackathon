Fraz Ahmed
===========================
Passionate Web Engineer, a Self Employed Entrepreneur and father of two. This is my first ever hackathon and I want to use this as an opportunity to learn something new. I am positive that in the end of this event my team will put something valuable on the table. This small effort of us will also have a positive impact to the world in one way or another!
