# ToSBot
### A Neural Network that Reads Legal Pages for You

* Koding URL: http://aphelionz.koding.io
* Client Github URL: https://github.com/npnd/global.hackathon/tree/master/Project
* Server Github URL: https://github.com/aphelionz/ToSBotNeuralNetwork

ToSBot is an app that reads ANY Terms of Service page and alerts you to potential legal, moral, and ethical issues that may exist within. Powered by a neural network seeded by the fantastic dataset at http://tosdr.org, this app learns as it goes and improves itself to give you more accurate results.

That being said, we encourage human input by providing a "feedback" mode which allows people to give feedback on whether the privacy policy or terms of service is better or worse in regards to the concern we raise. For example, if our machine says a particular ToS doesn't allow users to delete their data, and the language is unclear or even the opposite, we make it easy for a user to tell us that. 

## APIs Used
* Short URLs are generated via RuGu Shrink URL shortening API (provided by Mashape)
* All feedback from "Feedback Mode" are captured via Sprint.ly tickets
* APITools is used to track all API calls
* nginx powers the HTML/CSS/JS in the Web folder of the Koding 
* Count.ly username: info@npnd.com
* ODesk username: nopilotsnodemos (member since 2010)

Jordyn and Mark have been coding together both on and off the job for over 5 years. We initially joined the hackathon because of the opportunity to do something based on climate change. However, when the topics were announced, we both felt drawn towards the privacy policy / terms of service topic. That is the topic we ended up choosing.



We plan to make a web application to this effect. We have a good idea of what we're building. API choices are pending
