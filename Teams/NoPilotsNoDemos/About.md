Jordyn and Mark have been coding together both on and off the job for over 6 years now. We initially joined the hackathon because of the opportunity to do something based on climate change.

However, when the topics were announced, we both felt drawn towards the privacy policy / terms of service topic. That is the topic we ended up choosing.

We plan to make a web application to this effect. We have a good idea of what we're building. API choices are pending
