# Crafty Interface

My name is Vedran, I have a lot of ideas and I want to make some of them happen.

## About me

I'm a front-end developer who is excited about the endless potential of the web, and being able to build things that a lot of people can use every day. I'm passionate about my craft, I have a good eye for details and an absolute commitment to making sure features are well implemented. I always write maintainable front-end markup. I love responsive web design and mobile-first perspective. 

I can transform designs and concepts into efficient and lively interactive user experiences that are quick and responsive.

My second passion is crafting user interfaces with a seamless user experience in mind. Creating prototypes and wireframes is my joy. 

I have working knowledge on the application level programming with Ruby on Rails. I will be using RoR for making my idea happen.
