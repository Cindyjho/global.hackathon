##The Wunderbruders!


###About our team

We are two brothers originally from Brazil, but now both living in different parts of Germany. 
Our love for games brought us across the ocean to work in the digital games industry!

_Game Artist, Salsa Dancer, Latin Lover._


Starting in Brazil he has been exploring the world of game graphics in search of new exciting challenges.

His new quest brought him to work at MegaZebra in Munich, after having lived and worked in Recife, Helsinki, Berlin and Paris.
His amazing graphical skills will bring beauty to the project

_Programming Nerd, Coffee Drinker, Sleepy Dad._


Also from Recife, Brazil this guy made his way to Berlin to start a new life with new challenges in the Old World.
Unlike his brother, he decided to set foot and stay in just one place.

He now works as an Objective-C developer at Memorado, making Brain Training games, but his hobby is to code Javascript and get other people excited about programming.

#### The Project
We will be tackling the "Game to teach beginners how to code" category. If all goes well, we will continue the project after the Hackathon with the intent to make it an official [Hour of Code](http://hourofcode.com/) tutorial.
