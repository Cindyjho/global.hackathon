My name is Mona. I've worked as a software developer using C# and .Net framework. I chose to learn python and RoR to develop open source programs.

It's my first time joining a hackathon. I decided to participate as I need a purpose to develop applications. I need to make sure that my work is really helping other people. It is also a good chance to practice the new tools which I've been learning.

About your skills and what you are going to do?

I plan to use a python related web development framework, javascript, html5 and CSS. I'm mostly attracted to themes of games: introducing software development and HTML5 games.
