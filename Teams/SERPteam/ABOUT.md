We are a team of developers from Russia. We are working on their own start-ups, and some of the projects planned as opensource. We have a lot of interesting ideas, but the need to earn money does not allow us to devote much time to their start-ups. On the competition we have learned from the site habrahabr.ru and very interested as an opportunity to talk with other teams, as well as the chance to get funds for the development of our projects. If we win, the prize money will be spent on the development of useful new services and applications.

About our project.
===========================

We not a choose now which of our ideas to put into Hackathon, but as far as technology, the project will be based on Javascript. On the server we use Node.js, client-server communication via web sockets. Other details we will post before Hackaton.
