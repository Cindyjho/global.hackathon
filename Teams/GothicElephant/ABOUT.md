Project
================

During the hackathon we intend to develop a project focused on handling such a global problem as psychiatric illnesses.

**Why mental disorders make a global challenge?**

Statistically as many as 20-25% global population suffer this or that mental disease.

Meanwhile this statistics ignores the influence of psychiatric disorders of the sick on their families. It does not take into account the effect on the global economy either (covering expenses for hospital admissions, unemployment, disability allowances, unplanned vacations, etc.). But the latter turns this problem into the most  important one for the mankind.

**Which goals does our project pursue?**

We set two mutually important aims:

**1)**	To collect the information on the illnesses dynamics and various factors influence for further studies and treatment adjustment.

**2)**	To ease as much as possible patients’ sufferings by raising control over the disorder.

**How can our project tackle the problem?**

We are going to develop a system for collecting information about patients’ condition and forwarding the data gathered to doctors, psychologists, therapists, self-aid groups and researchers. 

**What about privacy?**

All personal data are to be syphered and be available for those who will be authorized by the user only. Researches will be able to obtain such information impersonally.

**Which information is the application to collect and how?**

We are well aware of our closest rivals who gather data about moving, talking, etc. and then analyse this information arriving at highly inaccurate results.  But we have chosen another way as it is the patient him/her-self who can be almost the best judge of his/her condition. Our client application is designed as a system for obtaining daily medical history through filling in customized tests.

**Why has our team picked up this topic and why are we confident in our project success?**

The idea for our project was born by our team member Olymzhon Iuldashev who personally had gone through alarm, panic attacks, depersonalization, derealization, depression, psychosis, euphoria, delusion, paraphrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Having but a very close experience of a close friend’s disease our team is aware of how important IT decisions are for mental patients and we know the way to deal with this global challenge
