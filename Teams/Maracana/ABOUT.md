Tell us who you are, why you did you decide to join?

I heard about the hackathon through a friend and decided to join.

This is my first time on a hackathon and the goal is to see how far I can go.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

I've been a web developer for 8 years and have a strong background on Java and JS. User interface design is my main problem.

The goal is to develop a game that can be an entry point to anyone into the programming world.
