About our team

===========================
I'm like a group of programming enthusiasts very motivated to solve real world problems. I'm
student enrolled in colleges in the Iran. I decided to join this competition 
because of our passion for programming and finding solutions for complex problems. I have prior
experience with developing applications making use of real time data to solve everyday problems.
Our biggest motivation behind us taking part in this competition is to get a really good 
feel of some of the API's mentioned in the document. I do not have much experience working with
these API's and would relish the opportunity to build something cool by utilizing them
