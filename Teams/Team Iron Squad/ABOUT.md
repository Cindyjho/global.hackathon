We decided to join the Hackathon for the opportunity to learn and be a part of a large community. This Hackathon will prove individual skills and ways for us to improve certain areas that we lack. Collaborating with various individuals on similar tasks is a fun and educational way to learn coding as well as building something innovative. 


About our skills

Each one of our team members has strengths and weaknesses in certain areas. Combined we are truly a force to be reckoned with. One opportunity, One Project, and our determination to give it our all!
