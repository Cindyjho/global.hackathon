We all live in the same city and know each other personally, but never tried
to work together... So why not try?  After all, who would resist opportunity
to spent 48 hours coding? :)


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

We are two Jav , one Python, and two Javascript developers.
Chances are that we're going to code in a completely different stack
(Clojure/ClojureScript?) though. 

Our goal is to scratch our own pain and to build service that would help
to write cleaner foreign language.  Natural language, I mean, like English.
