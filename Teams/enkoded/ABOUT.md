We all live in the same city and know each other personally, but never tried
to work as a team... though some of us do work together. So why not try?  
After all, who would resist an opportunity to spend 48 hours coding? :)


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

We are two Java, one Python, and two Javascript developers.
Chances are that we're going to code in a completely different stack
(Clojure/ClojureScript?) though. 

Our goal is to scratch our own itch and to build a service that would help
to write better in foreign languages.  Natural languages, I mean, like English.
