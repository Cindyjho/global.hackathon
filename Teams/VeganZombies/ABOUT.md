The Vegan Zombies
================

We're coming for your brains...  but since we're vegan, we won't actually eat them.

If you'd like to be a zombie too, please contact Loki at <lokkju@gmail.com> for more information.  We have 4 more slots currently.

Also known as Nick Jacobsen (though no one calls him that), Loki is a long time enterprise software developer who has been working in the onotological knowledge field for the past few years.  Recently, he has switched to working on providing value-added analytics for RTB decision systems.

He's also a photographer, hacker, and the founder of Portland's BrainSilo hackerspace.



About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======
Currently, our skill set covers most backend systems.  We're looking to add front end developers, and potentially full-stack or additional back-end talent.

We want to tackle EULAs and clickwrap agreements at both the software and service levels.
